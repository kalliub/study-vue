    <h1>Kalliu learning Vue</h1>
    <p>This page is my personal path through learning Vue3.</p>
    <p>
      The examples here are the ones I found on the official
      <a target="_blank" href="https://vuejs.org/examples">Vue documentation</a>, so I followed the
      same path they did, trying to understand and reproduce the main features I already know using
      ReactJS.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website will not have great design or CSS, because I'm focusing on learning the Vue
      fundamentals.
